Data Collection Services — Fast, Clean, Honest
   I’m a new freelancer with no prior client projects. I use official public APIs and reliable methods to collect, clean, and organize data—then deliver professional, ready-to-use reports in Excel, CSV, and HTML. No strategy or consulting; I focus on accurate collection and clear presentation.

**What I Deliver Today**
- Excel workbook (multi-sheet)
Main data, per-source tabs, Executive Summary, Data Dictionary
Crosstabs/charts on all platforms; native PivotTables + slicers on Windows
- CSV export (deduped, consistent schema) for CRM or analysis
- HTML summary (responsive, card-based) with key stats
- Provenance fields: Source and Collected At
- Light validation: de-duplication, basic cleanup, consistent types

**Data I Can Collect**
- Business data (Google Places, Yelp): names, addresses, phones, websites, categories, ratings, reviews, hours, price level (when available)
- YouTube (YouTube Data API): video/channel metrics, titles, descriptions, tags, engagement
- Reddit (API/PRAW or public JSON): posts, engagement, basic sentiment
- Real estate/rental (where feasible): addresses, prices, beds/baths/sq ft, URLs; compliant APIs/public datasets only; clearly labeled samples if live APIs aren’t available
- Public data only. I respect Terms of Service and robots.txt. Fields vary by source/time.

**How I Work**
- Define scope: targets (city/keywords/channels/subreddits), sources, fields, formats

- Collect via official APIs with rate limits and user-agent discipline

- Clean and validate: dedupe, normalize fields, add provenance/timestamps

- Organize and export: Excel (multi-sheet), CSV, HTML

- Quality check and handoff with a brief usage note
