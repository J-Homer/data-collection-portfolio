Data Collection Services — Fast, Clean, Honest
I’m a new freelancer with no prior client projects. I use official public APIs and reliable methods to collect, clean, and organize data—then deliver professional, ready-to-use reports in Excel, CSV, and HTML. No strategy or consulting; I focus on accurate collection and clear presentation.

What I Deliver Today
Excel workbook (multi-sheet)
Main data, per-source tabs, Executive Summary, Data Dictionary
Crosstabs/charts on all platforms; native PivotTables + slicers on Windows
CSV export (deduped, consistent schema) for CRM or analysis
HTML summary (responsive, card-based) with key stats
Provenance fields: Source and Collected At
Light validation: de-duplication, basic cleanup, consistent types
Data I Can Collect
Business data (Google Places, Yelp): names, addresses, phones, websites, categories, ratings, reviews, hours, price level (when available)
YouTube (YouTube Data API): video/channel metrics, titles, descriptions, tags, engagement
Reddit (API/PRAW or public JSON): posts, engagement, basic sentiment
Real estate/rental (where feasible): addresses, prices, beds/baths/sq ft, URLs; clearly labeled samples if live APIs aren’t available
Public data only. I respect Terms of Service and robots.txt. Fields vary by source/time.

How I Work
Define scope: targets (city/keywords/channels/subreddits), sources, fields, formats
Collect via official APIs with rate limits and user-agent discipline
Clean and validate: dedupe, normalize fields, add provenance/timestamps
Organize and export: Excel (multi-sheet), CSV, HTML
Quality check and handoff with a brief usage note
