I just started a full-time job at a larger (>1500 employee) business after seven years of first freelancing and then running a small marketing agency as a US S-Corp. I'm a dad in my forties and also have eldercare requirements outside of parenting stuff.

For my business, I went from generating $150,000+ annual revenue in 2019/2020 wit",0,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1izg9g6/just_started_a_ft_job_after_7_years_of_running_a/,1izg9g6
